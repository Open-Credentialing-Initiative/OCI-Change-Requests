# OCI-Change-Requests
This is a general repository where change requests (as Issues) can be placed for consideration.  The P&amp;A group, through the Triage process, will determine which OCI artifact is impacted and, if approved, will assign the Issue to a Repo or create a project and create sub-issues and assign each of them to Repos.
